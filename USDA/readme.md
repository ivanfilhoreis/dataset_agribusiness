## World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WAOB)

The data source of the time series was obtained from the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WAOB) 
from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [website](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde). The dataset is also available
at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ainslie/usda-wasde-monthly-corn-soybean-projections). However, here we update data from 2018 to 2021.

The period ranges from January 2014 to October 2021. The attributes represent several time-series features: planted area, harvested area, yield, beginning stocks, imports, supply, demand (World), and other estimates from countries with the most significant corn and soybean production.
